## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code is written using Pythons version 3.11.0. All libraries are available within the Anaconda distribution of Python.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

IBM provided a dataset of their online platform and reports interactions between users and articles. In the Jupyter Notebook, I work along several Udacity excercises to program different recommendation systems, that could potentially be used on the IBM Watson platform.  

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

My exploratory work on the IBM dataset is shown and described in detail in the file "Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb", which is also available in html.
The datasets are stored in the folder "data". The other files are necessary to validate the results in the Jupiter Notebook but are not relevant to get into understanding my project.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The Notebook starts an exploratory data analysis. It is then followed by three different recommendation systems.
I start with Rank Based Recommendations, followed by User-User Based Collaborative Filtering and finally the Matrix Factorization.
For detailed result please refer to the notebook Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb.


## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>

I have to thank IBM a lot for sharing this insightful dataset. 
The Jupiter Notebook with comments and some basic code was provided by Udacity. 
Thanks again to Udacity for pushing me to my limits!
